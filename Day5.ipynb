    "Regression is a parametric approach. ‘Parametric’ means it makes assumptions about data for the purpose of analysis. Due to its parametric side, regression is restrictive in nature. It fails to deliver good results with data sets which doesn’t fulfill its assumptions. Therefore, for a successful regression analysis, it’s essential to validate these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the important assumptions in regression analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There should be a linear and additive relationship between dependent (response) variable and independent (predictor) variable(s). A linear relationship suggests that a change in response Y due to one unit change in X is constant, regardless of the value of X. An additive relationship suggests that the effect of X on Y is independent of other variables.\n",
    "* There should be no correlation between the residual (error) terms. Absence of this phenomenon is known as Autocorrelation.\n",
    "* The independent variables should not be correlated. Absence of this phenomenon is known as multicollinearity.\n",
    "* The error terms must have constant variance. This phenomenon is known as homoskedasticity. The presence of non-constant variance is referred to heteroskedasticity.\n",
    "* The error terms must be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking care of assumptions is a bit advanced topic, so we will not be covering here. You can refer the article [Going Deeper into Regression Analysis with Assumptions, Plots & Solutions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/07/deeper-regression-analysis-assumptions-plots-solutions/) for more information."
